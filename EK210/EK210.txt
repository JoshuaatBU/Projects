In the course EK 210 - Introduction to Engineering Design, I worked with a team to design a bracelet that could remotely signal distress for the user. I programmed the micro controller that operates the device. It reads two button inputs. When the first is pressed, it activates an alarm and also uses an XBee 3 to send a signal on a Zigbee network. The second button is used for checking the current battery status (as the device is rechargeable) and also deactivates the alarm. The device regularly searches for signals, and if one matches the appropriate character, it sets off a notification alarm.
